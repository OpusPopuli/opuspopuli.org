      <p>
        When you scroll through your feed, an algorithm is representing your interests to you. You never voted for it. You can't vote it out. You can't even see the principles by which it operates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platforms that dominate civic life weren't built for citizens. They were built for engagement metrics, for data extraction, for quarterly revenue. They're designed to capture attention, not enable understanding. To maximize time-on-site, not help you make informed decisions and move on.
      </p>
      <p class="font-medium text-slate-dark">
        This isn't a technical problem. It's a power problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've delegated not just lawmaking to representatives, but something more fundamental: the curation of our information environment. And unlike elected representatives, we never chose the systems that now mediate our political reality.

        Rousseau believed freedom meant living under laws you've genuinely chosen for yourself. Not laws you've been manipulated into accepting. Not laws imposed by others. Laws that emerge from genuine understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        That kind of freedom requires infrastructure. In Rousseau's time: assemblies, pamphlets, public squares. In ours: civic technology designed for direct access rather than algorithmic mediation.

        We've delegated more than we realize. But we can reclaim it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not by abandoning technology. By building technology that serves democratic agency rather than replacing it. Infrastructure that enhances your sovereignty rather than delegating it. Tools that help you understand both your interests and the common good—rather than just showing you whatever keeps you scrolling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chains are still there: algorithms, platforms, engagement metrics. But they're not inevitable. They're choices—choices about what we build and who we build it for.
